## Installation / startup

The `code` directory contains the jupyter notebook and required python modules.

The notebook can be run locally or on google colab.
- To run it locally, please create a python environment with all the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
- To run it on colab, please follow the instructions in the notebook itself.

### Other files/directories 
- `artifacts`: 
  - presentation (ppt and pdf)
  - report (pdf and latex zip)
  - notebook (pdf)
- `final_submission` : final forecasts submitted on Kaggle;
- `models`: per-store models;
- `partial_submissions`: per-store forecasts;
- `m5-forecasting-accuracy.zip`: original files of the competition from Kaggle.

At runtime, two additional directories will be created:
- `extracted`: dataframes after zip extraction, in `csv` format;
- `preprocessed`: dataframes after preprocessing, in `parquet` format.
