## Installation

The `code` directory contains the jupyter notebook and required python modules.

The notebook can be run locally or on google colab.
- To run it locally, please check all the required libraries in the `requirements.txt` file.
- To run it on colab, please follow the instructions in the notebook itself.

### Other files/directories 
- `final_submission` : file with the final forecasts and submitted on Kaggle;
- `models`: per-store models;
- `partial_submissions`: per-store forecasts;
- `m5-forecasting-accuracy.zip`: original files of the competition from Kaggle.

At runtime, two additional directories will be created:
- `extracted`: extracted csv from the zip file;
- `preprocessed`: dataframes after preprocessing, in parquet format.
